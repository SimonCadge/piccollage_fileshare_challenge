# Simon Cadge PicCollage File Sharing Take Home Quiz

Welcome to my PicCollage take home quiz.  
I am just about to start developing, so currently this repository only contains a default ruby on rails application created by running `rails new app --database=postgresql` and a docker compose file to run both the rails app and the postgres database.  
There are no routes defined other than the standard healthcheck.  

### To Run:
 1. Ensure docker desktop / docker engine is running on your system.
 2. Create a .env file in the root directory containing the following variables:
    - DB_PASSWORD='whatever password you like'
    - DB_USER='whatever username you like'
    - RAILS_MASTER_KEY='the encryption key generated by rails. This shouldn't be uploaded to version control so you'll need to ask me for this personally or generate a new one for yourself by deleting the `credentials.ymc.enc` file and then running `rails credentials:edit`
 3. Run `docker compose up --build`
    - This will start the postgres db first, wait for the db healthcheck to show as healthy, and then start the rails app
    - The rails app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/up
