# Simon Cadge PicCollage File Sharing Take Home Quiz

Welcome to my PicCollage take home quiz.  
I now have a very simple app which lets you upload and download files. There is an index at `/shared_files` which lists all uploaded files and has links to the pages where you can create new ones or delete existing ones.  

Tests make use of active storage fixtures so we can easily test the file upload/download functionality.  
Running `rails test:all` will run the Controller, Model and System tests for SharedFiles.  

Expired links are now no longer downloadable.

Next steps:  
 - Create homepage which links directly to the shared_files new page.
 - Remove shared_files index so we don't list every file to all users (or just hide it, since the index page is useful for development).
 - Improve UI.
 - Deploy to AWS and integrate with S3.

### To Run:
 1. Ensure docker desktop / docker engine is running on your system.
 2. Create a .env file in the root directory containing the following variables:
    - DB_PASSWORD='whatever password you like'
    - DB_USER='whatever username you like'
    - RAILS_MASTER_KEY='the encryption key generated by rails. This shouldn't be uploaded to version control so you'll need to ask me for this personally or generate a new one for yourself by deleting the `credentials.ymc.enc` file and then running `rails credentials:edit`
 3. Run `docker compose up --build`
    - This will start the postgres db first, wait for the db healthcheck to show as healthy, and then start the rails app
    - The rails app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/up
